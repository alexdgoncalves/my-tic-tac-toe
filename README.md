# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React, based on the official React documentation's Tic Tac Toe tutorial.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This project implements the game using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Features

- Play against a friend locally on the same device.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Tracks the game's history, allowing players to revisit past moves.

3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to play the game.

## How to Play

- Players take turns clicking on empty squares to mark them with their symbol (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
